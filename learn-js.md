1350 Words

So you want to learn JavaScript. Great! JavaScript has been one of the most commonly used languages in the world for some time. It is powerful, diverse and can work on both front and back end applications. With a huge following, there are a number of courses available, vast communities and almost infinite support options available to any developer that decides to delve into the magical world of JavaScript. Of course, with such a large language you may find yourself wondering...Where to start? How to approach it? What should I learn first?

Well, let's take a look.

## How Long Does it Take to Learn Javascript

How long is a piece of string?

Honestly. There is no answer to this question. You may have a specific need for a certain functionality at first, or you may have decided you want to become as prolific with the programming language as you can manage. Either way, there are so many routes to the same result, this question is just un-answerable. In truth, I don't know there is a coder alive (or otherwise) that could claim to have 'learned JavaScript'. The classic saying 'Every day is a school day' couldn't be more true than when exploring this language.

The beauty of this language lies in this exact verity. A complete novice can start to learn at whatever speed they feel comfortable with. Likewise, a hardened scripting guru can further their knowledge at the same rate. The resources are almost limitless, the information is readily available and there are a thousand and one ways to do almost everything...and that is just the beginning!

Conversely, it takes a matter of minutes to learn JavaScript. In fact, you can start right now. Open up your devTools, locate the console and type `console.log("Hello world!");` and hit enter. You just wrote your first JavaScript. It may be basic and it may not seem that useful, but this is one of the most important tools when first starting out on your journey.

Don't believe it? Well, detailed below are a few key things to keep in mind as you start to script.

## What's the Best Way to Learn Javascript?

That depends entirely on your personal learning style. Some people can read about it, some people prefer to watch a video of someone writing it. Personally, I like to play around with it. You learn from your mistakes, so start making some. Whatever works best for you, do it slowly. Rome wasn't built in a day right? Well neither was JavaScript.

## Is Javascript Hard to Learn?

As we have discovered, there isn't really a way to say you have successfully learned JavaScript. You learn parts of it. Is it hard to learn parts of it? Sometimes, yes. If you dive straight in with the intention of learning complex methods without understanding the fundamentals, there is a high chance you will struggle.

If, however, you do as has been suggested - start slowly, learn what you are doing at each stage and really focus on gaining comprehension of the language - you will soon find yourself a `Foo Bar` virtuoso. The more you practice, the more you break and re-make, the more you experiment and explore the results, the more affluent you will become in this dark art.
