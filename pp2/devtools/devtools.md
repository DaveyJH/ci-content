### Intro

Hi everyone, welcome to my webinar on deciphering with devtools.

First, just a very brief intro.

I'm Dave, a student on the 5P course. I have just completed the advanced JS
modules that are presented later in the course, so hopefully my mind is a little
refreshed. That said, I apologise if I stumble at any point and refer to
something in a Pythonic way rather than JS. I will do my best not to!

Many of you will no doubt have noticed me diving in to every topic and every
question I can on Slack. I offer my opinion or thoughts, not the 'correct
answer', and I really encourage you all to do the same. It is through exploring
other people's problems that I have found so many interesting techniques and
skills that help me with my own code.

I had no previous programming knowledge before this course so I know how
daunting JavaScript can be. However, I did come from a background where things
would not always be as you would expect and I would have to use any and every
tool available to me to find the reason for that. In short...I press buttons to
find out what happens and I deal with the resulting carnage in a methodical way.

What I am going to talk about is my approach to debugging JS with devtools. It
is not the only way and it certainly isn't exhaustive so if you have other ideas
and tools and tips, please share them in the channel. The only competitions
during your time at CI are the hackathons (which you should all take part in) so
if you find something that will help your fellow students I strongly urge you to
share it.
